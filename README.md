This project (developed using the Foundry framework) consists on the creation of a vault which stores tokens locked for a certain amount of time and distributes rewards to depositors.

### Vault

- The vault accepts deposits of [Uniswap LP tokens](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2ERC20.sol) and locks them for a period (6, 12, 24 or 48 months)
- Depositors get rewards based on the deposited amount and lock period. These rewards take the form of ERC20 tokens.
- Depositors can claim their rewards at any time and can witdraw their deposit after the lock period is over
    - after the lock period of the LPs, the position stops accruing rewards.
- The vault is under a proxy, so the implemtation can be upgraded at anytime by the creators.

### OFToken

- The token implements the [Layer Zero Omnichain](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-an-omnichain-interoperability-protocol-b43d2ae975b6) OFT20 functionality
- Can only be minted by the Vault
- Has a fixed issuance rate of 10^10 tokens per year

### Vault v2

- The vault v2 implements Layer Zeroâ€™s functionality: [Omnichain](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-an-omnichain-interoperability-protocol-b43d2ae975b6)
    - to distribute the rewards, it uses the tokens deposited in all the Vaults in all chains that implement the Omnichain functionality.
    - it is only possible to withdraw or claim rewards from the same chain where the deposit was made.

### Implementation logic

To accurately and efficiently distribute rewards, the vault allows for 3 core operations: deposit, withdrawal and claiming rewards.

This deposits are stores as a linked list, sorted by the expiration time of every deposit.

A deposit is represented as a struct containing:

- address depositor - addres of the depositor
- uint128 deposit - initial deposit amount
- uint128 shares - number of shares minted (amount deposited x multiplier)
    - this multiplier is equal to (monthsLocked_ / 6)
- uint128 rewardsPerShare - amount of rewards per share at the start of the deposit
- uint64 expireTime - locktime expiration date (in seconds)
- uint64 nextId - pointer to the next entry in the list

Whenever a user makes a **deposit, withdrawal** or **claims rewards,** the vault starts by checking the sorted list for deposits that have expired. 
If an expired deposit is found, the system:
    - updates the rewards per share
    - adds the claimable rewards of the expired deposit to pendingRewards
    - adds the initial deposit to the withdrawableLPtokens so it can be withdrawn
    - burns the corresponding shares (reducing the total number of outstanding shares)
    - removes this element from the deposit list

### Build

Build the contracts:

```sh
$ make build
```

### Clean

Delete the build artifacts and cache directories:

```sh
$ make clean
```

### Compile

Compile the contracts:

```sh
$ make build
```

### Test

To run all tests execute the following commad:

```
make tests
```

Alternatively, you can run specific tests as detailed in this [guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests).
